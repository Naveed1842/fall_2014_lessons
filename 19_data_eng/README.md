### Additional Reading/Resources:

A few links from Varun:
- [Lambda Architecture](www.databasetube.com/database/big-data-lambda-architecture/)
- [Storm Tutorial](hortonworks.com/hadoop-tutorial/processing-streaming-data-near-real-time-apache-storm/)

Even more links:
- [Guide to Python Frameworks for Hadoop](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2013/01/a-guide-to-python-frameworks-for-hadoop/) (A little dated, but still a good read)

- [How to process a million songs in 20 minutes](http://musicmachinery.com/2011/09/04/how-to-process-a-million-songs-in-20-minutes/) --> **fun tutorial! I've tried it.**

SQL:
- [Learn SQL the hard way](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/)

(from last class's readings:)

- Google's uber famous 2004 paper on [MapReduce](http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html)
- Hadley Wickham's paper on [Tidy Data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)
- Yelp's [MRJob](https://pythonhosted.org/mrjob/)

#### Machine Learning and Math MapReduce Algorithms

- C. T. Chu et al provides an excellent description of machine learning algorithms for MapReduce in the article [Map-Reduce for Machine Learning on Multicore](Map-Reduce for Machine Learning on Multicore).
